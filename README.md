# Maze Search Algorithms
Implementing Depth-First Search, A* Search and Bidirectional A* Search to solve mazes. 

---
### Requirements:
Make sure Python 3.10.0+ is installed on your device. [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) will also be needed in order to install package requirements. To check your current python version, type: `python --version` in your command prompt or macOS terminal. <br><br>In macOS terminal or command prompt, navigate into `/maze-algorithms/` where the main.py file is located.<br><br>

## Virtual Environment Setup
### for macOS
- Create your virtual environment with `python3 -m venv virtualenv`.</br>
- Activate your virtual environment with `source virtualenv/bin/activate`.


### for Windows 
- Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv virtualenv`. </br>
- Activate your virtual environment with `virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

## Installing and Running the program
Install requirements (PyGame) by typing the code below into your macOS terminal or commmand prompt.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the file
Edit main.py to run different algorithms or to change maze files. On default, main.py runs all 3 search algorithms on maze-VLarge.txt. Maze visualizations can be found in `/maze-search-algorithms/visuals/`.
```
python main.py
```
